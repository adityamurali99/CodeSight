# CodeSight AI

CodeSight is an AI-powered code reviewer that finds bugs, security flaws, and logic errors in your Python code using a cloud-hosted GPT-4o brain.

## Features

1. Open a Python file in VS Code.
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows).
3. Type **"CodeSight: Review Current File"** and press Enter.
4. Look for the red squiggles. Click the lightbulb 💡 to apply the suggested AI fix.
